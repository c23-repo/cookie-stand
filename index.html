        <h2> About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Originally created as a personal snack, our organic, sugar free, and high protein cookies became an instant
          sensation between friends and family. Our mission was to make the perfect confection to be paired with a cup
          of coffee in the morning. As a family owned and operated business, Pat's Salmon Cookies is deeply rooted in
          the community, giving back a portion of every cookie sold to the less fortunate. So enjoy this delcious and
          nutricious way to start your day, while making a difference in your community.
